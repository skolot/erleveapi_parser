      <row medalID="40111" title="Maximum Extreme Solo PVP Master" description="Absolute undisputed and undefeated champion of solo kills for Darkstar 1, for all eternity shutup this cannot be argued.  Once there was a man.  A space man.  One day this space man decided I am going to kill people.  A lot of people.  With hurricanes.  And wouldn't you know it, he had a hurricane in almost every region of the game so this was his lucky day.  So anyway this guy get's in his hurricane and flies out to start attacking random people... oh wait wait I totaly forgot to mention something.  At first this guy was pretty terrible at PVP.  I mean he kept attacking ships bigger than himself and dying all the time.  But then guess what happened my friends?  He learned.  He adapted.  He evolved (lol BoB/Evolution).  And soon he was the best of the best.  I'm talking this guy was CRAZY shootin' his autocannons all up in people's butts.  So anyway, that guy wasn't available so we just decided to give this medal to Futility 101 instead." creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-22 23:04:00" />
      <row medalID="40113" title="The most inactive active player award" description="Awarded for excellence in logging in but not being too active because of his dedication to work in real life and his stalking of The Eagles football team.  This man gets beat up at his job regularly, usually by a guy named Joe.  But somehow, someway, he finds the strength to login and say hello in chat, sometimes even typing whole paragraphs.  How he can look so deep into himself and bring up that strength I have no idea.  But he does it.  Sometimes once a day at least.  Now if only he'd let go of his attractive wife for two seconds on a Tuesday night and come to wings, he would truly be a magnificent person." creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-22 23:26:00" />
      <row medalID="40116" title="The Winner Award" description="This award is given to those that win.  In times of need, in dark times, when the fate of everything is at stake this winner pulls through and brandishes the big W.  When all others gave up, or kept trying with admirable effort and yet still lost, this man did what no other man could.  He won.  He finished the task, completed the mission, saved the cheerleader and then the world.  Losers want to be him.  Other winners want to be him because he wins more and is a better winner than they.  Whenever you think you are winning, just take a peek ahead of you.  See that dust cloud?  That's him.  Winning.  Not you.  I think you get the idea." creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-22 23:52:00" />
      <row medalID="40120" title="The Lady Banger" description="This guy bangs ladies.  I'm talking lots and lots of ladies.  He's a veritable lady killer except he doesn't actually kill the ladies.  He bangs them.  Well technically it's entirely possible he could've banged some of them so hard they later died thereby making him &quot;the killer.&quot;  But these are unconfirmed and unsubstantiated rumors and frankly it's not fair of us to judge or assume.  That's for the law to decide.  But where was I... ah yes.  Lady banging.  Does it have breasts?  Banged it.  Long hair?  Banged it.  Is it even a woman, I mean did he bother to verify?  It doesn't matter.  Banged it.  This man takes no chances, wastes no opportunity.  He bangs.  Like a cannon.  A cannon loaded with awesome." creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-23 00:03:00" />
      <row medalID="40121" title="Blaze of Glory" description="You are what Bon Jovi sang about.  You did your duty, took one for the team, and died in a ball of fire.  Metal flying everywhere, your hull twisting apart, but you stood strong.  You stayed at your post seated calmly in your captain's chair.  You kind of had to use the restroom earlier but you thought NO if I step away I might miss the order to engage.  So you didn't.  You would have lived.  But living isn't always worth the price.  It wasn't meant to be.  You went down....down...down..... *dramatic pause* in a blaze....of glorrrryyyyyyyyy.... *fades out to dramatic music crescendo*" creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-23 00:16:00" />

See the he farts dust because it's all dusty up in there because of the aforementioned reason of being really really old.  But I digress.  He started playing EVE shortly after the game began, thinking to himself &quot;What are all these wonderful stars and spaceships and shit?&quot;  So he promptly made a minmatar character and then proceeded training other races and putting lasers on ships that had no business firing lasers.  Boy howdy he made some dumb mistakes.  But that was in his youth.  He's old now.  Not so much wise like you'd think though.  Just old.  Geez die already." creatorID="753005810" created="2009-12-23 18:21:00" />

If you're a man and you've got breasts like a women, then Tyreal will come calling.  But he's no moob raper, he takes it easy.  More like a laid back cruise around the lake rather then a speedboat chase as you'd see in them fancy action movies.  He stares you in the eyes as he slowly lowers his &quot;engine&quot; onto the &quot;landing.&quot;  Ease that throttle forward, gently swaying with the waves of man flesh.  Bpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbpbppb.  So let him take your man tits for a ride.  You'll be glad you did.
